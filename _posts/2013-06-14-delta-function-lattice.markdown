title: The &#948-function Potential Lattice
---

I was messing around with some simple problems, and found this simple but illustrative problem. It starts you off in basic quantum mechanics and introduces concepts in a very straightforward way to both get to a more condensed matter perspective while even showing some interesting effects that have experimental consequences (energy bands and band gaps opening).

We look at the relatively simple problem[^1] of finding the energy spectrum for a particle in the lattice potential

$$ U(x) = \alpha\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \delta(x - n a).$$

Visualized, it looks like the picture:

<img class="displayed" src="../img/Delta-fcn-lattice.png" alt="Delta function lattice." />

The time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation takes the form

$$ \left[ - \frac{\partial_x^2}{ 2 m} + U(x) \right] \psi(x) = E \psi(x), $$

where $$E$$ is the energy.

Since we can solve the problem between the delta-functions quite simply ($$U(x) =0 $$ there), let us restrict our focus to $$na < x < (n+1)a$$. Here, the wave function takes on the form

$$ \psi(x) = A_n e^{ik(x-na)} + B_n e^{-ik(x-na)},$$

where we have $$k = \sqrt{2m E}$$. Now, we can find an operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian so that we can diagonlize it to help solve the problem --- this will be the operator that translates us by $$a$$.

To make this clear, let us abstract things to operators so that we have a momentum operator $$   p$$ and a position operator $$   x$$, then we have the commutator $$ [   x,   p] = i$$. The operator $$  p$$ commutes with functions of $$  x$$ as though it were a derivative $$[  p, f(  x)] = -i f'(  x)$$, so considering the translation operator $$ e^{i a   p }$$, we can write

$$ e^{i a   p} U(  x) e^{ - i a   p} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!} U^{(n)}(  x) a^n = U(  x + a),$$

and since $$U(x)$$ is periodic in $$a$$, we have that $$e^{i a   p} U(  x) e^{ - i a   p} = U(  x)$$. Thus, the operator $$  T_a = e^{i a   p}$$ commutes with the Hamiltonian and we can simulataneously diagonalize both it and the Hamiltonian. We say $$  T_a \lvert \psi\rangle = e^{i a q} \lvert \psi \rangle $$ has _quasi-momentum_ $$q$$. It is important to note that this not the same as real momentum which is not a well-defined quantum number in this problem (that needs translation symmetry).

In other words, we can write our eigenfunctions such that $$ \psi(x+a) = e^{i q a} \psi(x)$$, and this naturally leads us to relate the coefficients for our eigenfunctions above as

$$ A_{n-1} = e^{-i q a} A_n, \quad B_{n-1} = e^{-i q a} B_n. $$

Now, we can apply matching conditions at $$ x = na$$ remembering that our wavefunction should be continuous, but that the delta-function will cause the first derivatives to be discontinuous. The equations for the coefficients are

$$
\begin{align*}
  A_n + B_n &  = e^{i k a} A_{n-1} + e^{-i k a} B_{n-1}, \\
  \left( 1 + \frac{2 i m \alpha}{k} \right) A_n - \left( 1 - \frac{2 i m \alpha}k \right) B_n & = e^{i k a} A_{n-1} - e^{-ik a} B_{n-1},
\end{align*}
$$

and if we insert the relation between the coefficients at $$n-1$$ and $$n$$, we get a matrix equation

$$
\begin{align*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    e^{i q a} - e^{i k a} & e^{i q a} - e^{- i k a} \\
    e^{i q a} \left(1 + \tfrac{2 i m \alpha}k \right) - e^{i k a} & - e^{i q a } \left( 1 - \tfrac{2 i m \alpha}k \right) + e^{-ik a}
  \end{pmatrix} 
  \begin{pmatrix}
  A_n \\ B_n
  \end{pmatrix} = 0
\end{align*}.
$$

This equation has a non-zero solution only if the determinant of the matrix is zero which can be written as

$$
  \cos q a - f(E) = 0 , \quad f(E) = \cos ka + \frac{m \alpha}{k} \sin ka.
$$

This is an equation which relates the energy to the quasi-momentum. Since $$\cos q a$$ can only be between -1 and 1, this equation only has a solution when $$f(E)$$ is between -1 and 1. The oscillatory nature of $$f(E)$$ means that it should pass in this range multiple (in fact, a countable infinite) number of times. 

Armed with this equation, we can use $$ q$$ and an integer to label our energies and we obtain the following energy bands by just solving for $$E$$ (setting $$m = 10$$, $$ a = 1$$, and $$ \alpha = 0.3 $$)

The dotted lines in this plot represent the spectrum if there were no delta-function potentials (displaced in energy by $$ \alpha / a $$ for clarity). Notice how the introduction of the delta-functions opens up gaps in this energy spectrum, so that there are some energies that are inaccessible. The gaps actually open up when $$\lvert f(E)\rvert \geq 1$$ since there is no solution to our equation there. This energy gap for small $$\alpha$$ just goes like $$\alpha/a$$, vanishing as we'd expect when $$\alpha = 0$$.

Notice that in this energy spectrum, we see that if $$q \rightarrow -q$$ we get the same energy. 

Additionally, if the energy ever goes negative the solutions turn from plane waves $$e^{\pm i k (x-na)}$$ into functions localized around the delta functions $$e^{\pm\kappa(x-na)}$$. In fact, the wave functions look like this for a $$q=0$$ state:

<img class="displayed" src="../img/Localized-states-delta-fcn-lattice.png" alt="Negative energy localized states in delta-function lattice with alpha less than 0." />

These only appear when $$\alpha <0$$, and are related to the fact that the delta-function potential has a bound state. Additionally, only one band can ever have this state. This is due to the fact that the oscillatory sine and cosine change to their non-oscillatory hyperbolic counterparts. However, these states in the delta-function lattice are spread out throughout the crystal, and can not be said to be "localized" to a specific site --- they still all have a definite quasi-momentum.

As with other single particle problems, upon considering the many particle picture, these energy bands get filled up to a set energy level (if we are considering fermions).
