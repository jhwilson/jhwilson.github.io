title: Spin-orbit coupled Hamiltonian
---

For applications in many parts of condensed matter physics and cold atoms physics, we use what is known as the spin-orbit coupled Hamiltonian. This Hamiltoninan is so-named because it couples momentum $\mathbf{p}$
to the spin $\mathbf{S}=\frac12\sigma$

$$H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \alpha (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \times \mathbf{p})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}} + \Delta \sigma_z.$$
