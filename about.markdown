Hello world. My name is Justin Howard Wilson, and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I study quantum mechanics and condensed matter theory under my advisor Victor Galitski. I have a broad range of interests from basic quantum theory, entanglement, quantum geometry, topological insulators, phase transitions, and Casimir effect. 

Sometimes while doing research I run into a little problem that's not really worth publishing because usually it's already widely known. But people are bad about writing those little things down, so this blog is partly my own little solution to that problem. Occassionally, there are other small tangential math or physics problems that steal my interest and I'll post on those here too.

Doing good research is also a primary concern of mine, so I post about tools here, online and off, that can be used to make research life easier. In addition, good style in writing and presentation is lacking in much of academic life. While I'm not perfect, I will post here about ways in my opinion to improve.
